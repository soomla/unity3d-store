***Important***: there are some breaking changes. Read the changes carefully.

* New Features
  * Work In Editor!
  * New local inventory that keeps all balances in memory so you don't need to go to the native DB. Saves JNI calls.

* Changes
  * In [StoreInfo](https://github.com/soomla/unity3d-store/blob/master/Soomla/Assets/Plugins/Soomla/Store/data/StoreInfo.cs) we replaces some funtions with public [variables](https://github.com/soomla/unity3d-store/blob/master/Soomla/Assets/Plugins/Soomla/Store/data/StoreInfo.cs#L512) that represent the collections of store metadata.
  * A class like the old [ExampleLocalStoreInfo](https://github.com/soomla/unity3d-store/blob/4dddde50607f83840fa1524f997c2568b90add11/Soomla/Assets/Examples/MuffinRush/ExampleLocalStoreInfo.cs) is **not** needed anymore. [StoreInventory](https://github.com/soomla/unity3d-store/commits/master/Soomla/Assets/Plugins/Soomla/Store/StoreInventory.cs) caches that info in memory and will be updated on runtime.
  * OnMarketPurchase event signature has changed. It now has a dictionary of extra information about the specific purchase for different native platforms (Android / iOS). More information [here](http://know.soom.la/docs/platforms/unity/events).

  * When onGoodUpgrade is being thrown, the current upgrade may be null. We now take care of it.
